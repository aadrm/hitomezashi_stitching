# hitomezashi_stitching

Very simple program that takes two phrases and converts them into a seed to generate Hitomezashi stitch patters.

The pattern is generated as strings of text in the console and that's later shown in a pygame window (the algorithm used to colour the pattern is whack, I just didn't spend much time on it as I did this while travelling)

requires pygame
